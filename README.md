# safensound
This project is an attempt to automate user flow going into google and searching for safensound.io to verify link exists.



Run the application from the pageLinkText.java under the src/test/java directory. 

I've created the project using a Page Object Model with the google and safensound page containing their own classes. 
The page objects are extended from BasePageObject.java.  

Project dependencies used: 
- Selenium Webdriver 
- Log4J
- Apache POI 
- Maven IDE
